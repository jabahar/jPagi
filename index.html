Age is a very high price to pay for maturity.</p>
<p>
Old age is no place for sissies.</p>
<p>
As I approve of a youth that has something of the old man in him so I am no less pleased with an old man that has something of the youth. He that follows this rule may be old in body but can never be so in mind.</p>
